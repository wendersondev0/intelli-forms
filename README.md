# Intelli-Forms

**Intelli-Forms** is a modern, AI-powered form builder designed to support a wide range of use cases — from basic data collection to intelligent quizzes, study plans, and AI-evaluated assessments. Inspired by tools like Google Forms and Anki, this project aims to evolve into a flexible platform that integrates Artificial Intelligence to enhance both the creation and analysis of forms.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a complete and scalable form builder application.
- Support multiple question types: text, number, single choice, multiple choice, file upload, and more.
- Allow forms to be shared via public/private links.
- Create forms for:
  - General data collection
  - Assessments with correct/incorrect answers
  - Study and flashcards (e.g., Anki-style learning)
- Integrate AI to:
  - Automatically generate entire forms from texts, images, or files.
  - Evaluate open-ended answers with explanations.
  - Create study schedules and question sets based on topics.
  - Support future implementation of custom-trained AI models.
